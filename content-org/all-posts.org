** Pee
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: pee
:EXPORT_HUGO_URL: pee
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :_build '((list . never))
:END:
I've been thinking about it for days and I can't get it off my mind since
you said on twitter you wanted to find somebody to pee on and idk and
I don't want you to hate me cos you're really cool and I really like
spending time with you and you get me andd I think you're really
nice and also you're based and idk I think we're very similar
in a good way but

do you want to pee on me, if you don't I completely understand and we never
have to talk about it again and I will be very normal about

if you do yippe

liek again I totally understand that you don't and I don't want to make
it wierd between us it;''just that ever since we talked about pee on
shrooms I haven't been able to get my mind of off it and it's new to
me cos i wouldn't say i've ever had such an obsession on it but I
can't stop thinkign about pee now and maybe it's the mushrooms
rewiring my brains but idk I think it's that being able to find
someone that was so open about it made me realise it's okay
aactually no it's mroe about beign able to accept a part of
myself or at least expoolring it idk if i'm really into pee
or if it's just the lack of familiarity to it that makes me this way
but I actually wrote a poem about pee a coupkle days ago

#+begin_quote
My relationship to my own fluids is one of indifference,
and yet,\\
I yearn to know what I would feel.\\
Lying in a bathtub, drenched in that transient stream of essence.\\
That which embodies the silent symphony of the body's release,\\
A fleeting whisper echoing the cyclical rhythm of life's flowing cadence.
As my paw slides softly across the neck of this guitar, as I search for
the right key, as the chords melt together in a cacophony of noise.\\
It's too loud, I think to myself, I should play softer, way softer.\\
I smile, as I write down the dynamic on the sheet music:

as of 2024-02-11, I am someone's puppy amd girlfriend skldjfskdljf
so hapy been giddy all day and literally skipping
#+hugo: more
we were kinda chilling on the couch after taking edibles and I was getting
touchy cos high and ka was kinda touching me and showing me stuff on phone
and then I asked if ka wanted to put a collar on me, and then ka did and
then I asked I could kiss cheek and then we kinda kissed a bit later
and

dfsdklfjsdklfjsdlfkjsdfkljsdfsdfjlsdkfjlsdkfsdlkfjsdlkfsdlkfjsdlkfjsdlkfjs dlkfdslkfjsdflkjsadf;lasdjfl;asdjfsdalkfasfasdlkf;'sadf;kasldjfas;ldkfjasld;kf jasdl;fkjasdl;fkjasdl;fkjasd;lfkjsadl;fkjasdf;ljkasdfasdjlf;ajsdfl;kasdfl;aksj fl;asdkfasl;kdfla;skjfals;kdjfasdl;kfjasdl;kfjsdaklfjasdklfjas;dfsdklfjsdklfjsdlfkjsdfkljsdfasdfjsdk'

and we talked a whole bunch and we were giggling and thne ka called me cute and
I frickin lost it and I was blushing and I'm still blushing tbh and yeah
so now I'm girlfriend and we are furry partners in crime and we're gonna
commit arson and maybe someday I get to meet ka's other girlfriend and then
we can all be cool together and make the government collaps

also I wanna start a band together and I just need to get two people
to pick up an instrument and learn......
we got this tho cos like I can play all the instruments for the first
album if we need, the others just need to start playing at live shows
once we get to that point and once you start playing shows you learn
really easily, in my experienece at least

and I have a few song ideas and a couple lyrics, but the others are all
really good at writing stuff so I think I just ask em for lyrics and then
make a few chord progressions based on that and badabim badaboom, guitar solo
\+ drums + bass playhing the root note you got a song
also it's folk punk/new hardcore so it doesn't really matter if it's to the
taste of cissies and straights cos we don't care about that demographic
it's music for the gay furries, by the gay furries yk

so yeah that's been my 2 last days and rn feeling pretty good and happy

What is it that makes me?\\
What defines who I am?\\
#+hugo: more
Who declared those things and ingrained them in me.\\
Like corrupted cells, nigh dead breeding.

I struggle to find myself an identity, nothing feels wholly like me.\\
A girl perhaps? Bygone vision of gender as a performance,\\
dance like the rest to feel true to you, me.\\
A dog maybe? Yet it fails to define my passions, my loves, my fears.\\
A maid, a wife, a friend given maw, snout and tail.

#+begin_quote
girl. dog. platonic. romantic. sexual. prude.\\
freaky. vanilla. smart. stupid. diligent. lazy.\\
empty. free. wild. tamed.
#+end_quote

Certainly some, Certainly none, Childhood wishes left unanswered.\\
The calls keep coming, none are for me.\\
Those I hold dear won't listen, I've cried wolf before.\\
Awakened the night, tears fell like morning dew.\\
Whom made me. Unto whom do I pray for my name.

Is a name enough, with drugs consigned?\\
Learn to speak, to move, to dance, to be, be the better person I long to see.

Now closer to belonging, to freedom, to understanding.\\
Closer to that shadow of the perfect me.\\
The further I stray from identity, the more it defines me.\\
This I know is me.

I do what I do, act as I am, love who I love and care for those around me.\\
I am who I am, or pretend to be.\\
Perhaps that, is who I want to be.
