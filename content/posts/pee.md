I've been thinking about it for days and I can't get it off my mind since
you said on twitter you wanted to find somebody to pee on and idk and
I don't want you to hate me cos you're really cool and I really like
spending time with you and you get me andd I think you're really
nice and also you're based and idk I think we're very similar
in a good way but

do you want to pee on me, if you don't I completely understand and we never
have to talk about it again and I will be very normal about

if you do yippe

liek again I totally understand that you don't and I don't want to make
it wierd between us it;''just that ever since we talked about pee on
shrooms I haven't been able to get my mind of off it and it's new to
me cos i wouldn't say i've ever had such an obsession on it but I
can't stop thinkign about pee now and maybe it's the mushrooms
rewiring my brains but idk I think it's that being able to find
someone that was so open about it made me realise it's okay
aactually no it's mroe about beign able to accept a part of
myself or at least expoolring it idk if i'm really into pee
or if it's just the lack of familiarity to it that makes me this way
but I actually wrote a poem about pee a coupkle days ago

> My relationship to my own fluids is one of indifference,
> and yet,<br />
> I yearn to know what I would feel.<br />
> Lying in a bathtub, drenched in that transient stream of essence.<br />
> That which embodies the silent symphony of the body's release,<br />
> A fleeting whisper echoing the cyclical rhythm of life's flowing cadence.
> As my paw slides softly across the neck of this guitar, as I search for
> the right key, as the chords melt together in a cacophony of noise.<br />
> It's too loud, I think to myself, I should play softer, way softer.<br />
> I smile, as I write down the dynamic on the sheet music:
