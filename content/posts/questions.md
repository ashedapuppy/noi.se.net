What is it that makes me?<br />
What defines who I am?<br />

<!--more-->

Who declared those things and ingrained them in me.<br />
Like corrupted cells, nigh dead breeding.

I struggle to find myself an identity, nothing feels wholly like me.<br />
A girl perhaps? Bygone vision of gender as a performance,<br />
dance like the rest to feel true to you, me.<br />
A dog maybe? Yet it fails to define my passions, my loves, my fears.<br />
A maid, a wife, a friend given maw, snout and tail.

> girl. dog. platonic. romantic. sexual. prude.<br />
> freaky. vanilla. smart. stupid. diligent. lazy.<br />
> empty. free. wild. tamed.

Certainly some, Certainly none, Childhood wishes left unanswered.<br />
The calls keep coming, none are for me.<br />
Those I hold dear won't listen, I've cried wolf before.<br />
Awakened the night, tears fell like morning dew.<br />
Whom made me. Unto whom do I pray for my name.

Is a name enough, with drugs consigned?<br />
Learn to speak, to move, to dance, to be, be the better person I long to see.

Now closer to belonging, to freedom, to understanding.<br />
Closer to that shadow of the perfect me.<br />
The further I stray from identity, the more it defines me.<br />
This I know is me.

I do what I do, act as I am, love who I love and care for those around me.<br />
I am who I am, or pretend to be.<br />
Perhaps that, is who I want to be.
