as of 2024-02-11, I am someone's puppy amd girlfriend skldjfskdljf
so hapy been giddy all day and literally skipping

<!--more-->

we were kinda chilling on the couch after taking edibles and I was getting
touchy cos high and ka was kinda touching me and showing me stuff on phone
and then I asked if ka wanted to put a collar on me, and then ka did and
then I asked I could kiss cheek and then we kinda kissed a bit later
and

dfsdklfjsdklfjsdlfkjsdfkljsdfsdfjlsdkfjlsdkfsdlkfjsdlkfsdlkfjsdlkfjsdlkfjs dlkfdslkfjsdflkjsadf;lasdjfl;asdjfsdalkfasfasdlkf;'sadf;kasldjfas;ldkfjasld;kf jasdl;fkjasdl;fkjasdl;fkjasd;lfkjsadl;fkjasdf;ljkasdfasdjlf;ajsdfl;kasdfl;aksj fl;asdkfasl;kdfla;skjfals;kdjfasdl;kfjasdl;kfjsdaklfjasdklfjas;dfsdklfjsdklfjsdlfkjsdfkljsdfasdfjsdk'

and we talked a whole bunch and we were giggling and thne ka called me cute and
I frickin lost it and I was blushing and I'm still blushing tbh and yeah
so now I'm girlfriend and we are furry partners in crime and we're gonna
commit arson and maybe someday I get to meet ka's other girlfriend and then
we can all be cool together and make the government collaps

also I wanna start a band together and I just need to get two people
to pick up an instrument and learn......
we got this tho cos like I can play all the instruments for the first
album if we need, the others just need to start playing at live shows
once we get to that point and once you start playing shows you learn
really easily, in my experienece at least

and I have a few song ideas and a couple lyrics, but the others are all
really good at writing stuff so I think I just ask em for lyrics and then
make a few chord progressions based on that and badabim badaboom, guitar solo
\\+ drums + bass playhing the root note you got a song
also it's folk punk/new hardcore so it doesn't really matter if it's to the
taste of cissies and straights cos we don't care about that demographic
it's music for the gay furries, by the gay furries yk

so yeah that's been my 2 last days and rn feeling pretty good and happy

```rust
pub fn puppy_brain() {
    loop { println!("*tail wag*") }
}
